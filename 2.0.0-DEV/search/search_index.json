We've used it on both a survival and a MMORPG server.</p> <p>I have 0 complaints. It's well thought through and getting better by the day. The day BetonQuest 2.0 (you can do like me and use the dev version) comes out, will be a beautiful day for all server owners.</p> <p>/Fred, Esron, Znitsarn.</p>   <p>This is a brilliant plugin. It is so much more than just a plugin for quests. It is a set of tools that allow you to do so many things. I feel like this is a must have for any server that wants to add functionality to citizens NPCs even without using it for making quests. The possibilities are endless. You can have very immersive complex conversations that can be used to explain server functions, create shops, teleport players, make portals etc. [...] The possibilities are limited only by what you can think of doing. I started out looking for a quest plugin and after using this, I wished I had used it before just for the sake of the immersion it adds. [...]</p>   <p>This is the most comprehensive quest plugin I have seen. I am still amazed this is free. The devs are extremely active, continue to make new things available, and have a clear roadmap to offering even more features. I am in awe of their skills and dedication.  I am truly blown away by the support team. They are the absolute best. They answer things quickly and thoroughly. I really cannot say enough good things about this quest plugin!</p>   <p>This is actually my second review after 2 years which goes to show the complexity and skill behind this plugin. Many reviews have stated many times how powerful, complex and overall useful this plugin is. Comparing it to other quest plugins is simply not good because its so powerful I would put it on the level on a minor scripting language. The versatility and scale of this plugin has seen it develop to the backend of some powerful RPG servers! [...]  This is all taken however apart from the most important and influential part of the plugin and that is the developers. I have seen an entire range of developers come and go from the OG Co0sh to the current team and all of them have given it 110%. From releasing patches on the same day bugs have been reported to spending hours and hours in calls with users it is impossible not to realise how much the developers care about the plugin and all its users. Their care and hundreds of hours of dedication are shown in this insanely powerful and (mostly) bug free quest plugin. Anyone who aspires to give their players a  proper RPG experience needs to check this plugin out.

You need to create a class extending <code>QuestEvent</code> for each new event. The constructor must take one argument, an <code>Instruction</code> object. In the constructor you must extract all information from the instruction, for example skill names, locations etc. The description of the <code>Instruction</code> class is down below. Don't worry about checking event conditions, these are handled by the rest of BetonQuest's logic.</p> <p>Events are not bound to any player so firing it is done through <code>fire(String playerID)</code> method. You have to override it with your code responsible for doing stuff your event should do. Here you should use data previously parsed by the constructor. Don't access <code>Instruction</code> object here, it will lower the performance. You can convert <code>playerID</code> to <code>Player</code> object using the <code>PlayerConverter</code> class (it's a relict of times when both UUIDs and names could be used in Bukkit to identify players).</p> <p>If you want your event to be persistent, you need to set <code>super.persistent</code> variable to <code>true</code> in the constructor. This will make BetonQuest run this event even if the <code>playerID</code> points to an offline player, so prepare your code for that.</p> <p>If you want your event to be static, you need to set <code>super.staticness</code> variable to <code>true</code> in the constructor. This will allow BetonQuest to run this event with <code>playerID</code> set to <code>null</code>, so prepare your code for that.</p> <p>When you'll finish your class you need to invoke <code>registerEvents(String name, Class&lt;? extends QuestEvent&gt; class)</code> from BetonQuest instance (which you can get using <code>BetonQuest.getInstance()</code> static method). The name for your event will be used in instruction strings (such as \"journal\" for journal event). The class argument is the <code>Class</code> object of your event. You can get it using <code>YourEvent.class</code>. That's it, you created an event. Don't forget to check it for bugs!</p>  <p>Warning</p> <p>IDE's typically autocomplete the wrong constructor.

You register them using <code>registerConditions(String name, Class&lt;? extends Condition)</code> method from BetonQuest instance as well. The rest is almost the same, you're defining the constructor which will parse the <code>Instruction</code> object and overriding <code>execute(String playerID)</code> method to check if the player meets the condition. Don't worry about inverting it, as it's automatically done by BetonQuest.</p> <p>Conditions are always getting an online player in the <code>execute(String playerID)</code> method, so you don't need to check that manually.</p>  <p>Warning</p> <p>IDE's typically autocomplete the wrong constructor.

They extend <code>Objective</code> class. As always, you need to extract all data from supplied <code>Instruction</code> object in the constructor. Don't register listeners in the constructor!</p> <p>If your objective handles changing data (like amount of mobs left to kill) you should create a class extending <code>ObjectiveData</code>. For example <code>block</code> objective does need to store amount of blocks left to place/break, and it does that using \"BlockData\" class. In the constructor it receives three strings: data string, ID of the player and ID of the objective. The latter two are used by BetonQuest to correctly save and load the former one from the database.</p> <p>The data string should contains all the information you need in your objective. You must write a parser which will extract the information, methods used in the objective to alter the information, and override the <code>toString()</code> method in so it returns data string in the format parsable by your parser. Everytime the data in your object changes (like when killing a mob), you need to call <code>update()</code> method. It will save the data to the database.</p> <p>Now you should override <code>getDefaultDataInstruction()</code> method. It must return the default data instruction understandable by your parser. For example in <code>tame</code> objective it will return the amount of mobs to tame. If you don't use data objects, just return an empty string (not <code>null</code>, just <code>\"\"</code>).</p> <p>In order for your objective to use the data object you have created you need to set the <code>template</code> variable to this object's class. If you're not defining the data object (because you don't need to handle the changing data), you should set the <code>template</code> simply to <code>ObjectiveData.class</code>.</p> <p>Every time your objective accepts the player's action (for example killing the right mob in MobKill objective) it must be also verified with <code>checkConditions()</code> method. You don't want your objective ignoring all conditions, right? When you decide that the objective is completed you should call <code>completeObjective()</code> method. It will fire all events for you, so you don't have to do this manually.</p> <p><code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code> methods must start objective's listeners and stop them accordingly. It's because the plugin turns the objective's listeners off if there are no players having it active. Here usually you will register/unregister listeners, but some objectives may be different. For example <code>delay</code> objective starts and cancels a runnable, instead of using listeners.</p> <p>If your objective has some properties (used in variables) you should override the <code>String getProperty(String property, String playerID)</code> method. At runtime, if anyone uses <code>%objective.yourObjective.theProperty%</code> variable, BetonQuest will call that method with <code>theProperty</code> keyword as the first argument. Using it you should parse the data of the objective and return it as a String.

Player's data isn't touched to avoid lags made by database saving. The database is also the same, you will have to reload/restart the whole server for the database to change.</p> <p>Tags subcommand allows you to easily list and modify tags. '<code>/q tags Beton</code>' would list tags for player Beton. '<code>/q tags Beton add test</code>' would add \"test\" tag for that player, and '<code>/q tags Beton del test</code>' would remove it.</p> <p>Points subcommand is similar - listing points is done the same way. Adding points to a category looks like that: '<code>/q points Beton add reputation 20</code>' (adding 20 points to \"reputation\" category). You can also subtract points with negative amounts. Removing the whole point category can be achieved by '<code>/q points Beton del reputation</code>'.</p> <p>Journal subcommand works in the same way as those two above. Adding and removing looks like <code>/q journal Beton add default.wood_started</code> (or <code>del</code>), and you can also specify the date of entry when adding it, by appending date written like this: <code>23.04.2014_16:52</code> at the end of the command. Note that there is <code>_</code> character instead of space!</p> <p>Objective subcommand allows you to list all active objectives (shown as their labels) of the player. It can also directly add or cancel objectives using instruction strings. You can also complete the objective for the player using <code>complete</code> argument - it will run all events and remove the objective.</p> <p>Running events for online players can be done with event argument: '<code>/q event Beton give_emeralds</code>' would run \"give_emeralds\" for player Beton (if he's online) from default package (not necessarily \"default\" but rather the default one specified in config.yml). If you want to run a static event, replace player's name with <code>-</code>.</p> <p>There is also condition argument for checking conditions, for example '<code>/q condition Beton has_food</code>'. Events and conditions need to be defined in their files, this command doesn't accept raw instructions. You can skip package name, the plugin will assume you're reffering to package specified in <code>default_package</code> option in config.yml file. If you want to check a static condition replace the player's name with <code>-</code>.</p> <p>If you need to create for example \"Nettlebane\" quest item, just hold it in your hand and type '<code>/q item nettlebane</code>'. It will copy the item you're holding into the items.yml file and save it there with the name you specified (in this case \"nettlebane\"). You can skip the package name here as well.</p> <p>The '<code>/q give package.item</code>' command will simply give you specified item.</p> <p>Config subcommand is used to modify or display values in configuration files. <code>set</code> option replaces the value with what you typed, <code>add</code> simply adds your string to the existing value. (Note on spaces: by default the plugin won't insert a space between existing and added value. You can however achieve that by prefixing the string with <code>_</code> character. For example: existing string is <code>objective location</code>, and you want to add <code>100;200;300;world;10</code>. Your command will look like <code>/q config add default.events.loc_obj _100;200;300;world;10</code>). <code>read</code> option allows you to display config value without modifying it.</p> <p>Path in this command is like an address of the value. Next branches are separated by dots. For example language setting in main configuration has path <code>config.language</code>, and a text in \"bye\" player option in default quest has path <code>default.conversations.innkeeper.player_options.bye.text</code></p> <p>You can purge specific player with '<code>/q purge Beton</code>' command, where Beton is the name of the player. To purge the entire database at once simply change the prefix in config.yml or delete database.db file.</p> <p>Delete command ('<code>/q delete</code>') allows you to delete from the database every tag, point, objective or journal entry with specified name.</p> <p>Rename command ('<code>/q rename</code>') allows you to rename every tag, point, globalpoint, objective or journal entry in the database. In case of an objective it will also rename the objective in objectives section in the configuration file, so it continues to work correctly.</p> <p>If you want to backup your configuration and database make sure that your server is empty (this process requires all data to be saved to database -&gt; all players offline) and run '<code>/q backup</code>' command. You will get a zip file containing all your data, ready to be unzipped for restoring the plugin.</p> <p>Update command ('<code>/q update</code>') will try to download the newest version of the plugin and save it to the update folder. This folder is then handled by Spigot to update the plugin. If you accidentally use this command but do not wish to update the plugin, you should remove <code>BetonQuest.jar</code> file from the <code>plugins/update</code> folder before restarting/reloading the server.</p> <p>Using '<code>/q create beton</code>' command you will create new package named '<code>beton</code>'. It will contain the default quest.</p> <p>The <code>/q vector</code> command allows you to create vector variables from the specified in first argument location variable to your position. The result will be saved to the \"vectors.{second argument}\" variable.</p> <p>The debug command ('<code>/q debug</code>') allows you to enable or disable the debug mode. If the debug mode is enabled after server startup ('<code>/q debug true</code>'), all log entries from the configured log history time frame are written to the <code>/plugins/BetonQuest/logs/latest.log</code> file as history and writing will be continued until the debug mode is disabled using ('<code>/q debug false</code>'). The <code>latest.log</code> is renamed to the current date and time on server startup. It's useful if you search for more information about an issue and can help developers to fix bugs.</p> <p>The command ('<code>/q debug ingame</code>') allows you to manage your ingame debugging. The ingame debugging sends you live information about quests to your chat. Running the command without any argument shows your active filters. If you don't have any filters active you will see all console output from <code>/q reload</code>. If you have filters active you only see information from the selected packages. Appending a package name activates the filter for that package. You can also use <code>*</code> / <code>MyFolder-*</code> instead of a package name to address all packages / all packages of a folder. Appending a level allows you to select which types of messages are displayed. The default level <code>error</code> shows all <code>WARNINGS</code> and <code>ERRORS</code> from the log. If you want to see more information use the levels <code>info</code> or <code>debug</code>. Beware though, the debug level might be spammy.</p>","title":"Main command details"},{"location":"Documentation/Compatibility/","text":"<p>In total 30 plugins have dedicated support for BetonQuest.</p> <p>BetonQuest hooks into other plugins by itself to provide more events, conditions and objectives or other features.  25 plugins are supported right now:   AureliumSkills, Brewery, Citizens, Denizen, EffectLib, Heroes, HolographicDisplays, JobsReborn, LuckPerms, Magic, mcMMO, MythicLib, MMOCore, MMOItems, MythicMobs, PlaceholderAPI, ProtocolLib, Quests, Shopkeepers, SkillAPI, Skript, Vault, WorldEdit, FastAsyncWorldEdit and WorldGuard.</p> <p>Some plugins also hook into BetonQuest and provide support by themselves: nuNPCDestinations, CalebCompass, NotQuests</p> <p>There are also plugins that hook into BetonQuest that require a clientside mod: BetonQuestGUI, NGVexJournal</p>","title":"Compatibility"},{"location":"Documentation/Compatibility/#aureliumskills","text":"","title":"AureliumSkills"},{"location":"Documentation/Compatibility/#conditions","text":"","title":"Conditions"},{"location":"Documentation/Compatibility/#skill-level-aureliumskillslevel","text":"<p>Checks if the player has the specified skill level.

An example of such variable is <code>%location%</code>, which shows player's exact location. Simply place it instead of coordinates. There is one rule though: you can't use variable base types in events running without players (for example static events or the ones run from folder event after their player left the server). BetonQuest won't be able to resolve the location variable without the player!</p> <p>The vector is a modification of the location. It will be useful if you use global variables instead of base (described in the next subsection) or the base itself is variable, like <code>player</code>. Vectors look like <code>-&gt;(10;2.5;-13)</code> and are added to the end of the base. This will modify the location, X by 10, Y by 2.5 and Z by -13. For example, location written as <code>100;200;300;world_nether-&gt;(10;2.5;-13)</code> will generate a location with X=110, Y=202.5 and Z=287 on <code>world_nether</code> world.</p>","title":"Unified location formating"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#global-variables","text":"<p>You can insert a global variable in any instruction string.

You will get a detailed description about what is wrong. If you still don't know how to solve it, ask the developers on Discord for help with PMD.</p>   <p>Visit the SpotBugs Page for general info.  SpotBugs searches for additional problems, most of them are potential bugs.

BetonQuest will use it to determine what type of event is used and what exactly it should do. <code>mega</code> is the event's name, <code>notify</code> is the events type and <code>Hello world!</code> tells the notify event what it needs to display. In this case, if you run <code>mega</code> event, it will display <code>Hello world!</code> as a chat message. Now save the file, issue /q reload command and run the event with /q e {name} default.mega command (<code>q</code> is shortcut for <code>quest</code>, <code>e</code> is shortcut for <code>event</code>, <code>{name}</code> is your Minecraft name without the brackets, <code>default</code> is the package/quest and <code>mega</code> is the name of the event we've just created).

They are not connected in any way. Condition names and event names are separated, so you can give them the same name without any problems. Now let's look at the instruction string. As you can suspect, <code>location</code> is a type of the condition. This one means that we'll be  checking if the player is near that location (you should change the location to the place where you're standing right now, so you don't have to run around the world). Note that at the end of location argument there is an additional number, <code>5</code>. This is the maximum distance you can be away from the location to meet the condition. Alright, save the file and reload the plugin.</p> <p>Now walk to the location you have defined in the condition. Try to stand on the exact block corresponding to that location.  Issue /q c {name} default.mega command (<code>c</code> is shortcut for <code>condition</code>). It should show you \"Condition blah blah blah: true\". We're focusing on that last word, true. This means that you're meeting the condition: you're standing within 5 block radius of the location. Now move 2 blocks away and issue that command again. You should still be meeting the condition.  Walk 4 more blocks away and try now. It should show false. You are now outside of that 5 block radius. Get it? Great.</p> <p>Now I'll show you the simplest use of those conditions. Open the events.yml file again, and at the end of <code>mega</code>  instruction add <code>conditions:mega</code> argument. By the way, rename your events to something that actually fits the type of the event, otherwise it will get confusing really fast. Example:</p> events.ymlconditions.yml   <pre><code>  # This is a comment btw\n  # Old:\n  mega: \"notify Hello world!\"\n\n  # New:\n  sayHello: \"notify Hello world! conditions:isAtSpawn\"\n</code></pre>   <pre><code>  # Old:\n  mega: \"location 100;200;300;world 5\"\n\n  # New:\n  isAtSpawn: \"location 100;200;300;world 5\"\n</code></pre>    <p>Now <code>sayHello</code> event will run only if it meets <code>isAtSpawn</code> condition. Reload the plugin, walk outside of the 5 block radius and try to run <code>sayHello</code> event. Puff, nothing happens. It's because you're not meeting <code>isAtSpawn</code> condition. Walk into the radius again and try to run that event now. It should happily display the <code>Hello world!</code> notification.</p> <p>It's very nice that we can add such conditions, but the problem is: what if you wanted to display the notification only if the player is outside the radius? Don't worry, you don't have to specify <code>inverted_location</code> condition or anything like that. You can simply negate the condition. Negation makes the condition behave in the exact opposite way, in this case it <code>isAtSpawn</code> will be met only if the player is outside of the 5 block radius, and it won't be met if he's inside. Open the events.yml and add an exclamation mark before the <code>isAtSpawn</code> condition, so it looks like this:</p> <pre><code>  sayHello: \"notify Hello world! conditions:!isAtSpawn\"\n</code></pre>  <p>This means \"display the <code>Hello world!</code> notification if the <code>isAtSpawn</code> condition is not met\".

Imagine you have 100 events, <code>foo24</code>, <code>bar65</code>, <code>baz12</code> etc. You would get lost pretty quickly. So, <code>add_beton_tag</code> event here simply adds <code>beton</code> tag to the player, <code>del_beton_tag</code> removes it. Save the file, reload the plugin and run this event. Nothing happens... or does it? Issue /q t {name} command (<code>t</code> is shortcut for <code>tags</code>). It should show you a list with few entries. Right now focus on <code>default.beton</code>, the rest are used by the default quest for Innkeeper.

You don't have to specify <code>default.beton</code>, but you can if you want. Now save, reload and check it with a command.

Add it again with <code>add_beton_tag</code> event and check the <code>has_beton_tag</code> condition again. Now it will show true.</p> <p>Now you probably understand how powerful this system is.

Open it, we'll use that for reference. Now create a new file, let's say miner.yml. Now type (don't copy-paste it, you'll learn better while typing) that into the file:</p> <pre><code>conversations:\n  miner:\n    quester: Miner\n    first: greeting\n    NPC_options:\n      greeting:\n        text: Hi there, traveler!\n</code></pre>  <p>It's the most basic conversation possible. The NPC named <code>Miner</code> upon starting the conversation will use <code>greeting</code> option, which means he will say <code>Hi there, traveler!</code>. Then the conversation will end, because there are no player options defined. Now you need to link the conversation with an NPC. For that you now need to create or select another NPC. Then you link your conversation to the npc in the package.yml file. Open it now. As you can see the previous NPC conversation is linked to <code>Innkeeper</code> word. Now add another line under the Innkeeper: <code>'1': miner</code>, save the file and reload the server. This will link our new conversation with the NPC with the id \"1\". Now click on that NPC.</p> <p>Guess what, the conversation finished right after it started.  The Miner just said <code>Hi there, traveler!</code>, as expected. Now go to the conversation file and edit it (again, manually, no copy-paste!) so the options look like this:</p> <pre><code>    NPC_options:\n      greeting:\n        text: Hi there, traveler!\n        pointers: hello,bye\n    player_options:\n      hello:\n        text: Hello!\n      bye:\n        text: I need to go, sorry.\n</code></pre>  <p>When you save the file, reload the plugin and start the conversation again you will notice that there are two options for you to choose: <code>Hello!</code> and <code>I need to go, sorry.</code> Choosing any of them will end the conversation, because these options did not specify any pointers.</p> <p>Now add a new NPC option, for example <code>weather</code> with text <code>Nice weather.</code> and make <code>hello</code> player option point to it. When you save&amp;reload, the Miner should say <code>Nice weather.</code> when you tell him <code>Hello!</code>. I think you get how it works.</p> <pre><code>    NPC_options:\n      greeting:\n        text: Hi there, traveler!\n        pointers: hello,bye\n      weather:\n        text: Nice weather.\n    player_options:\n      hello:\n        text: Hello!\n        pointer: weather\n      bye:\n        text: I need to go, sorry.\n</code></pre>  <p>Now, every time you talk to the Miner, he will say the same thing. It would be nice if the second time you talk to him he knew your name. We can do that with tags. Define a <code>meet_miner</code> event and <code>has_met_miner</code> condition. When you talk to the Miner for the first time, he will check if you have met him. If not, he will meet you (with that event) and next time you talk, the condition will be passed and he will use your name.</p> <p>Now, rename <code>greeting</code> NPC option to <code>first_greeting</code>. Add <code>meet_miner</code> event and negated <code>has_met_miner</code> condition (negated because this option should only show if the player has not met the Miner yet). You will need to surround the condition with <code>''</code>, because strings cannot start with exclamation marks in YAML. It should look like this:</p> <pre><code>    first: first_greeting\n    NPC_options:\n      first_greeting:\n        text: Hi there, traveler!\n        condition: '!has_met_miner'\n        event: meet_miner\n        pointers: hello,bye \n</code></pre>  <p>This means: <code>first_greeting</code> should be used if the player does not pass <code>has_met_miner</code> condition (meaning he doesn't have a tag because he haven't talked to the NPC yet). When this option is used, it will fire <code>meet_miner</code> event and display <code>hello</code> and <code>bye</code> options. Alright, but what happens if the player met the Miner and now negated <code>has_met_miner</code> condition doesn't work? NPC will try to use next option defined in <code>first</code> setting. There is none yet, so let's add it.</p> <pre><code>    first: first_greeting,regular_greeting\n    NPC_options:\n      regular_greeting:\n        text: Hi %player%!\n        pointers: hello,bye\n</code></pre>  <p>This option does not have any conditions, so if the <code>first_greeting</code> fails, the NPC will always choose this one. Now take a look at the <code>%player%</code> thing. It's a variable. In this place it will show your name. There are more than this one, they are described in Reference chapter. Alright, save&amp;reload and start the conversation. If you did everything correctly, the Miner should greet you as a \"traveler\", and the second time you talk to him, he should greet you with your Minecraft name.</p> <p>Here's the whole conversation you created, so you can check if you understood everything correctly:</p> <pre><code>conversations:\n  miner:\n    quester: Miner\n    first: first_greeting,regular_greeting\n    NPC_options:\n      first_greeting:\n        text: Hi there, traveler!\n        condition: '!has_met_miner'\n        event: meet_miner\n        pointers: hello,bye \n      regular_greeting:\n        text: Hi %player%!\n        pointers: hello,bye\n      weather:\n        text: Nice weather.\n    player_options:\n      hello:\n        text: Hello!\n        pointer: weather\n      bye:\n        text: I need to go, sorry.\n</code></pre>  <p>Now you should experiment some more with this conversation, you can help yourself by looking at the innkeeper.yml file. Try to understand how that conversation works step by step. As the excercise you should complete the Miner NPC, so he asks you to mine some iron ore, then smelt it in the furnace, next craft an armor with it and return to him wearing this armor.</p> <p>You might want to check out the Reference chapter to see how to handle items in  your quests and how to add entries to the journal.

There are multiple reasons why you really need one:</p> <ul> <li>Working on a live server could lead to crashes and bugs that your players will have to deal with.</li> <li>Making quests can, especially for new questers, lead to unexpected behavior. This can be anything from spawning hundreds of mobs to endlessly giving out items to a player.

We are going to install Paper (an improved version of Spigot) on your computer.  Head over to Papers download page and click on the button you see in the image below (the numbers will not match up, ignore that). </p> </li> <li> <p>Step 2: Create a new folder for the server in a place you can easily access.  Making a new folder is important because the server will create a lot of files that would mess up your Desktop etc. Move the downloaded file in the newly created folder. If the file's name is something like \"paper-X.YY.Z-100\" rename it to <code>paper</code>. If the name contains a \".jar\" ending just change the part in front of the ending to <code>paper</code>. Example:  paper-X.YY.Z-100 -&gt; paper paper-X.YY.Z-100.jar -&gt; paper.jar</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 3: You need a start script to start your server. Open your text editor and create a file named <code>start.bat</code> (For Linux and Mac: Create a <code>start.sh</code> file instead). Place it in the freshly created folder. Open it and copy this into it: <pre><code>java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar paper.jar --nogui\npause\n</code></pre> This script tells java to search for a file named <code>paper.jar</code>. The <code>1G</code> setting in both the <code>-Xms</code> and <code>-Xmx</code> options is how much RAM you want to give to the server  (<code>1G</code> = 1 GigaByte RAM, <code>2G</code> = 2 GigaByte RAM, <code>700M</code> for 700 MegaBytes, etc.). You should not need more then 1GB in most cases though.    Make sure to save it as a <code>.bat</code> file! If you save it as a <code>.txt</code> file it will not work. </p> </li> <li> <p>Step 4: Start the server by double-clicking on the start file. A console window will appear and close after a while. Just wait until its gone. Now check the server's folder. You will find a bunch of new folders and files that have been generated. You need to accept the EULA (Minecrafts End-User-License-Agreement)to be able to run a Minecraft server. You will find a link in the eula.txt file. After you read it you need to set <code>eula=false</code> to <code>eula=true</code>. The start file now serves as the start button for the server.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Next step: Install BetonQuest.</p>","title":"Setup of your local server"},{"location":"Tutorials/Getting-Started/Setting-up-the-editor/","text":"<p>In theory, you can edit quests with any editor.
